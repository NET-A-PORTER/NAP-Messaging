- warning when setting JMSType in a "transform" method
- the "destination" attribute for transformers is no longer required,
  as long as they set some value in the "destination" header
- transformers get their configuration passed in to the constructor,
  making things more uniform and simpler

1.5.0     2012-10-05 17:11:55 Europe/London
- producer validation used to compile the specs at role-application
  time, now it waits until first use; this helps in a few cases where
  you need an instance to generate the full spec
- added NAP::Messaging::Utils, currently only has 1 function,
  object_message

1.4.1     2012-10-18 13:05:54 Europe/London
- allow a Producer to not have @type set automatically

1.4.0     2012-09-12 16:27:46 Europe/London
- add producer validation
- serialisation is now completely handled inside NAP::Messaging::Serialiser
- clearer log when receiving an unhandled message
- documentation diagrams in the docs/ subdir, and ::Migration pod

1.3.0     2012-08-17 16:40:37 Europe/London
- failure handling is factored better, easier to change from
  ::Consumer subclasses
- new role to get to Catalyst's ->model method
- ::Consumer components are loaded automatically (previously you had
  to configure your Catalyst to do it)
- destination mapping in producers / transformers is exposed via
  methods, in case you need it (e.g. for JMSReplyTo header)
- Test::NAP::Messaging now has a config_hash parameter, to pass an
  application's config and get the right producer configuration

1.2.0     2012-08-02 15:40:51 Europe/London
- NAP::Messaging::Role::Producer has a preprocessor, by default it
  stringifies DateTime objects
- test helpers, Test::Deep-style: napdate($datetime) and atleast($number)

1.1.0     2012-07-30 10:59:58 Europe/London
- added LogTrapper, to tie STD{OUT,ERR} through the logger (defaults
  to disabled)
- unhandled messages (of unknown types, or delivered outside our
  subscriptions) are sent to the proper DLQ, instead of ignored

1.0.0     2012-07-17 11:34:14 Europe/London
- initial release, extracted from NAP-DocIntegrator
